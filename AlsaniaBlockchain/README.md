**Alsania Blockchain: A Quantum-Resistant, Scalable Ecosystem Anchored by the AlsaniaCoin (ALSC)**  
**Version 2.0**  

---

## **1. Introduction**  
The **Alsania Blockchain** is a next-generation, quantum-resistant, and highly scalable decentralized network designed to **enhance financial security, governance, and Web3 adoption**. At its core is the **AlsaniaCoin (ALSC)**, a deflationary utility token that powers all network operations. ALSC enables **secure, low-cost transactions, staking, governance, and decentralized AI training**, while **maintaining compliance** with global regulations such as **U.S. SEC/FinCEN and EU MiCA**.  

To ensure seamless microtransactions, Alsania introduces **Embers**, a sub-denomination of ALSC, with a **conversion rate of 10¹⁸ Embers = 1 ALSC**, allowing for precise transaction fee calculations.

## **2. Vision**  
The Alsania Blockchain aims to create a **self-sustaining blockchain economy** where:  

- **ALSC drives intrinsic value** → Used for fees, staking, governance, and incentives in the Web3 ecosystem.  
- **Quantum-resistant security** → **Lattice-Based Cryptography** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) protects against quantum attacks.  
- **Unparalleled scalability** → **EVM-compatible L2 rollups** with **dynamic sharding and ZK-Rollups** ensure high throughput and low fees.  
- **Seamless compliance** → **Zero-Knowledge KYC (ZK-KYC)** ensures privacy while meeting regulatory requirements.  
- **Decentralized AI innovation** → A **community-governed AI training framework** upholds data privacy and integrity.  
- **Interoperability with major blockchains** → Supports **cross-chain bridges** to **Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and more**.

#### **3.7.2 Governance-Driven Data Curation**  
- ALSC holders vote on which datasets are approved for AI training through on-chain governance.  
- A reputation system rewards contributors who provide high-quality data, weighting their votes more heavily in governance decisions.  
- ZK-KYC ensures contributor accountability while preserving privacy.  

#### **3.7.3 Consensus-Based Data Validation**  
- Validators verify the quality and relevance of training data, staking ALSC to participate in the process.  
- Regular data audits are conducted using smart contracts and community-driven mechanisms.  

#### **3.7.4 Privacy-Preserving AI Training**  
- Federated learning allows the AI model to be trained locally on users' devices, with only model updates shared.  
- Homomorphic encryption enables computations on encrypted data, ensuring sensitive information is never exposed.  

#### **3.7.5 Incentivizing High-Quality Contributions**  
- Contributors are rewarded with ALSC for providing high-quality data.  
- A portion of the ecosystem fund (15% of transaction fees) supports data collection, curation, and AI training initiatives.  

#### **3.7.6 Preventing Bad Information Input**  
- Automated AI-based filters detect and flag low-quality or malicious data.  
- Governance participants review flagged data and decide whether it should be included.  
- Penalties, such as slashing staked ALSC, are imposed on contributors who intentionally provide bad data.  

#### **3.7.7 Transparent and Auditable AI Training**  
- All decisions related to AI training (e.g., dataset approvals, model updates) are recorded on the blockchain.  
- Smart contracts manage different versions of the AI model, linking them to the datasets and governance decisions that contributed to their training.  

#### **3.7.8 Community-Driven AI Evolution**  
- Community members propose improvements to the AI model through a proposal system.  
- Feedback mechanisms allow users to report issues or biases in the AI's outputs, refining the model over time.
