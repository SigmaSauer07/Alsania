# Alsania Blockchain

## Overview
The Alsania Blockchain is a next-generation, quantum-resistant, and highly scalable decentralized network designed to enhance financial security, governance, and Web3 adoption. At its core is the AlsaniaCoin (ALSC), a deflationary utility token that powers all network operations.

## Core Technologies
- Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
- Lattice-Based Cryptography (CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- EVM compatibility and Ethereum L2 support
- Dynamic Sharding
- ZK-Rollups
- Cross-Chain Bridges
- Decentralized Storage with IPFS/Filecoin
- Zero-Knowledge KYC (ZK-KYC)
- GDPR-Compliant Data Encryption
- Smart Contracts & Web3 Development
- Decentralized AI Training Framework
